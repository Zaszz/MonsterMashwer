This pack only includes the cards, it is not a game.
This pack includes one example scene (ExampleScene) to show you the cards.

ExampleScene controls:

	-Right mouse button to drag the camera.
	-Mouse wheel zoom.
	-To change the language (english/spanish) click on 'L' icon button at Top-Right corner into the cards.

This pack also includes a few captures about the making process on ./MakingProcess/.
If you need to edit the text of the cards please go to ./Tutorials_and_Info/How_Edit.txt
Each card contains 'Reverse' child gameobject, this is the reverse of the card.

The ExampleScene is only one example about how you can use the cards, anyway you can use the images as you want.
Basically the card structure is:
	-Base card image 'Front Card.png'				(147x240)	(./Pack/Images)
	-Card portrait (for example 'Demon.png')		(111x86)	(./Pack/Images)
	-Title and content text.
	-Reverse of the card.							(147x240)   (.Pack/Images/Reverse)
